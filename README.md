# Hello, CDK!

This is the code project for the [Hello, CDK!](https://davidpallmann.hashnode.dev/hello-cdk) blog post. 

This episode: AWS Cloud Development Kit and Infrastructure-as-Code. In this Hello, Cloud blog series, we're covering the basics of AWS cloud services for newcomers who are .NET developers. If you love C# but are new to AWS, or to this particular service, this should give you a jumpstart.

In this post we'll introduce Amazon CDK and write AWS infrastructure-as-code in C#. We'll do this step-by-step, making no assumptions other than familiarity with C# and Visual Studio. We're using Visual Studio 2022 and .NE

## Our Hello, CDK Project

We will develop, in a single C# solution, two AWS Lambda functions and a CDK project. The CDK project will define infrastructure for the Lambda functions and Amazon API Gateway endpoints. We'll deploy and later destroy a stack using the CDK CLI.

See the blog post for the tutorial to create this project and run it on AWS.
